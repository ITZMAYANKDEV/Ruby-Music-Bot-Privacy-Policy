- Saturn Bot Privacy Policy -

Our Discord bot is designed to provide users with a better experience on Discord servers. This privacy policy explains how and what data
is collected by our bot, how it is used and how it is protected.

We at Saturn know you care about your personal information and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more
about our Privacy Policy.

We do not share or sell your personal information for advertising or marketing purposes. We also do not share your personally identifiable
information with third parties except as required by law.


The following information is saved for the proper functioning of Saturn Bot:

- User IDs (to associate you and your server members with your registered configurations)
- Server IDs (stored only in some cases for information such as your language preferences, server configuration in case of moderation bots and leveling bots)
- Channel IDs (for channel-specific command overwrites and configurations)
- Role IDs (for role-specific command overwrites and configurations)
- Message IDs (for message specific features such as Role menu, reaction roles, reaction validation)
- Any user-supplied content, which may include text for greetings, reminders, rank cards


It also indicates that you have granted Admin permission when adding Saturn Bot to your server and that you accept this with your 
explicit consent. Admin permission is a very important permission that allows the bot to manage your server as it pleases and should
only be granted if you trust the bot. Also, some admin commands may not work properly if you do not grant this permission. By granting 
admin permission, you accept full responsibility and agree that the bot's administrator cannot be held responsible for any errors that
may occur.
